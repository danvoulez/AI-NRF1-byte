# Samples: Receipts

This folder will contain canonical examples generated by CI:
- `allow.json` : minimal ALLOW receipt (signed form as `.signed.json`)
- `allow.nrf`  : canonical NRF bytes (without `sig`)
- `keys/`      : demo Ed25519 keys

Artifacts are produced by the CI pipeline and copied into `dist/` for inspection.
