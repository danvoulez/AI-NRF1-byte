# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you believe you've found a security issue, please **do not** open a public issue.
Email the maintainers privately (set your address here) with the details and a repro if possible.

We aim to:
- Acknowledge receipt within 72 hours.
- Provide a fix or mitigation plan within a reasonable timeframe depending on severity.

## Scope
- Canonical encoding/decoding logic (Rust/Python).
- Interop profiles (when enabled) and their parsers.
