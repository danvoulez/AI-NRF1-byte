# Contributing

1. Discuss changes in an issue.
2. Keep core spec minimal (no-decisions). Interop belongs in separate docs.
3. Add tests/vectors for any normative change.
4. Run conformance kit locally before PR: `make conformance` (TODO).

By submitting a PR you agree to license your contribution under the repository license.
